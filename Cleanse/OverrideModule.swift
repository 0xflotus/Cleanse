/**
 An override module overrides functionality in the `Overrides` component defined by the implementor. It is required to have 0-arguments as a constructor
 
 `OverrideModule` functionality should only be used in Tests or "Debug" mode.
 
 
 - Note: `Override` APIs are experimental at best, and may just go away. Please don't depend on it too much. They are somewhat of a leaky abstraction, but make testing a lot easier
